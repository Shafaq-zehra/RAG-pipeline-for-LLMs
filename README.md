# RAG-pipeline-for-LLMs
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that dynamically retrieves information from Wikipedia and generates context-aware answers using a Transformer-based Question Answering model. It demonstrates how retrieval-based reasoning can enhance language model performance by grounding responses in real-world data instead of relying solely on model memory.

Problem Statement
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but limited by the information they were trained on. They cannot access real-time or domain-specific knowledge.
This project solves that problem by integrating a retrieval system (Wikipedia-based) with a question-answering model ‚Äî allowing the model to extract relevant facts from reliable sources before generating answers.

Goal:
To create an intelligent, factual, and explainable question-answering system that retrieves real data and answers user queries with high accuracy.

Tech Stack:

 How It Works

User Input: The user enters a topic (e.g., Quantum Computing).

Retriever: The system fetches relevant content from Wikipedia.

Chunking: The text is tokenized into smaller chunks for efficient vectorization.

Embedding & Indexing: Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformer and indexed using FAISS.

Query Embedding: The user‚Äôs question is embedded in the same space.

Similarity Search: FAISS retrieves the most relevant chunks based on cosine similarity.

Answer Generation: The retrieved context is passed to a RoBERTa QA model, which extracts the most probable answer.

Key Learnings & Challenges:

What I Learned

How RAG architectures combine retrieval and generation to improve factual accuracy.

Building and indexing semantic embeddings with FAISS for fast vector search.

Using transformer-based QA models (RoBERTa) for contextual answer extraction.

Handling chunking, token limits, and retrieval optimization effectively.

 Challenges Faced

Managing large Wikipedia text efficiently during retrieval.

Handling tokenization overlap to maintain context across chunks.

Balancing retrieval speed and answer quality using FAISS tuning.

Debugging import and environment compatibility issues with transformers.

 Future Improvements

 Integrate Semantic Scholar / Google Scholar APIs for academic paper retrieval.

Add multilingual support for non-English queries.

Deploy as a Streamlit app for interactive exploration.

 Use quantized FAISS indices for faster similarity search.
